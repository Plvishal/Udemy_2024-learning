//Project Name- PlacePicker
///

1. The idea behind of this project is to pick your favorite places
2. We can done with the help of longitude and latiude 3. From this level of placepicker have problem :Infinite Loop:- setting avialableplaces 3. We can solve this problem using useEffect() hooks
3. When we are refreshing the our browser we lost our data but we can solve this in browser without backend with help of localStorage
4. Every Side Effect don't need a useEffect hooks
5. Remember when we are use useEffect here it runs Synchronously and exectued by line
6. When we are put this value out of function because we don't need to executed to again and again
7. When user want to remove item from list but after 3 sec item remove even we are clicking on No because behind the scene setTimeOut() is running
